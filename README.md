## 🔬 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Medical Informatics**.  
I aim to build *trustworthy, interpretable, and resilient AI systems* that support real-world healthcare decision-making.

- 🧩 **Clinical Summarization and Long-Context Modeling (Kyoto University Hospital)** —  
  Applied the **NBCE method** (originally proposed by Su Jianlin) to optimize automatic summarization of long clinical records.  
  This work was conducted at the [Medical Informatics Planning Division](https://medinfo.kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp/members/),  
  addressing the limited context window of 7B-scale models through **dynamic retrieval** and **TF-IDF-based alignment** strategies.

- 🤖 **Ethically-Constrained Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Healthcare Systems (Takayuki Ito Laboratory)** —  
  My current PhD research at the [Takayuki Ito Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/kyoto-u.ac.jp/takayukiitolaboratory/home)  
  explores the **Kallipolis Medical Republic model**, a dynamic multi-agent framework inspired by control theory,  
  social contract philosophy, and large language model cognition.  
  This work conceptualizes hospital systems as **complex adaptive organizations**,  
  where autonomous agents (doctors, nurses, administrators, patients) coordinate through ethical communication mechanisms  
  and reinforcement learning under **semantic constraints** known as the *Holy Code*.  
  The framework integrates LLM-based action generation with a critic that jointly reasons over both  
  operational outcomes and moral consistency—achieving context-aware, interpretable, and safe decision-making.

- 🔍 **Future Work** —  
  I plan to extend this semantic reinforcement framework toward **multi-modal clinical reasoning**  
  by integrating structured EHR data, imaging, and text into a unified decision space.  
  In parallel, I aim to investigate **adaptive value systems** for multi-agent negotiation and governance,  
  enabling AI systems to balance efficiency, fairness, and ethical stability in complex healthcare environments.  
  Ultimately, this research envisions a new paradigm of *AI governance as an evolving moral-technical ecosystem*.
