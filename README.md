## 🔬 Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Medical Informatics**.  
I aim to build *trustworthy, interpretable, and efficient AI systems* that can support real-world healthcare operations.

- 🧩 **Clinical Summarization and Long-Context Modeling** —  
  Developed the **NBCE method** (*Non-Buffer Context Extension*) to optimize automatic summarization of long clinical records, addressing the limited context window of 7B-scale models through dynamic retrieval and TF-IDF-based alignment.

- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Intelligent Healthcare Systems** —  
  Proposed a **four-layer agent architecture** with hybrid decision mechanisms to dynamically coordinate nursing schedules and optimize hospital resource allocation.

- 🔍 **Future Work** —  
  I plan to explore the integration of **LLM reasoning with reinforcement learning** to enable adaptive decision-making in multi-agent medical environments, and to extend these frameworks to **multimodal diagnostic and procedural planning tasks**.
